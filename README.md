# Custom Gallery Application 

## Overview
This Android project embraces modern development practices, featuring MVVM architecture for a robust structure. Utilizing Coroutines and Flow enhances asynchronous programming, ensuring a smooth user experience. LiveData is employed for seamless communication with views, fostering dynamic UI updates. Hilt facilitates Dependency Injection, promoting modular and maintainable code.

## Key Features
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a scalable and organized codebase.
- **Coroutines and Flow**: Efficiently handle asynchronous operations.
- **LiveData**: Enables real-time data updates in the UI.
- **Hilt for DI**: Simplifies Dependency Injection for better code structure.
- **Material Design**: Enhances the visual appeal with a modern design language.
- **Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito**: Ensures code reliability and maintainability.
- **UI Testing with Espresso**: Validates the app's UI behavior for a seamless user experience.
